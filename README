FUNCTIONS
    YAML::Tiny implements two functions to add compatibility with the YAML
    API. These should be a drop-in replacement, except that YAML::Tiny will
    not export functions by default, and so you will need to explicitly
    import the functions.

  Dump
      my $string = Dump(list-of-Perl-data-structures);

    Turn Perl data into YAML. This function works very much like
    Data::Dumper::Dumper().

    It takes a list of Perl data strucures and dumps them into a serialized
    form.

    It returns a string containing the YAML stream.

    The structures can be references or plain scalars.

  Load
      my @documents = Load(string-containing-a-YAML-stream);

    Turn YAML into Perl data. This is the opposite of Dump.

    Just like Storable's thaw() function or the eval() function in relation
    to Data::Dumper.

    It parses a string containing a valid YAML stream into a list of Perl
    data structures.

NAME
    YAML::Tiny - Read/Write YAML files with as little code as possible

PREAMBLE
    WARNING: THIS MODULES IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE

    The YAML specification is huge. Like, really huge. It contains all the
    functionality of XML, except with flexibility and choice, which makes it
    easier to read, but with a full specification that is more complex than
    XML.

    The pure-Perl implementation YAML costs just over 4 megabytes of memory
    to load. Just like with Windows .ini files (3 meg to load) and CSS (3.5
    meg to load) the situation is just asking for a YAML::Tiny module, an
    incomplete but correct and usable subset of the functionality, in as
    little code as possible.

    Now, given the YAML features one would need in order to have something
    that is usable for things like META.yml and simple configuration files,
    there is still enough complexity that I'm not sure if it is even
    possible to do a YAML::Tiny module.

    So I'm going to impose some ground rules before I start.

    Like the other "::Tiny" modules, YAML::Tiny will have no non-core
    dependencies, not require a compiler, and be back-compatible to at least
    perl 5.005_03, and ideally 5.004.

    And I'm setting a hard-limit of 400k of memory to load it (1/10th of
    YAML.pm).

    I plan to implement features starting at the most common and working
    towards the least common, but if we hit 400k limit then we stop until we
    can find a way to squish the same functionality into less code and free
    some up.

    At this point, other than unquoted scalars, arrays, hashes and ASCII, I
    promise nothing.

    So do not use this module for anything other than experimentation. It's
    only just getting started.

SYNOPSIS

        section:
          one: two
          three: four
          Foo: Bar
          empty: ~
    
        #############################################
        # In your program
    
        use YAML::Tiny;
    
        # Create a YAML file
        my $yaml = YAML::Tiny->new;
    
        # Open the config
        $yaml = YAML::Tiny->read( 'file.yml' );
    
        # Reading properties
        my $root = $yaml->[0]->{rootproperty};
        my $one  = $yaml->[0]->{section}->{one};
        my $Foo  = $yaml->[0]->{section}->{Foo};
    
        # Changing data
        $yaml->[0]->{newsection} = { this => 'that' }; # Add a section
        $yaml->[0]->{section}->{Foo} = 'Not Bar!';     # Change a value
        delete $yaml->[0]->{section};                  # Delete a value or section
    
        # Add an entire document
        $yaml->[1] = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];
    
        # Save the file
        $yaml->write( 'file.conf' );

DESCRIPTION
    YAML::Tiny is a perl class to read and write YAML-style files with as
    little code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead.

    Most of the time it is accepted that Perl applications use a lot of
    memory and modules. The ::Tiny family of modules is specifically
    intended to provide an ultralight and zero-dependency alternative to the
    standard modules.

    This module is primarily for reading human-written files (like config
    files) and generating very simple human-readable files. Note that I said
    human-readable and not geek-readable. The sort of files that your
    average manager or secretary should be able to look at and make sense
    of.

    YAML::Tiny does not generate comments, it won't necesarily preserve the
    order of your hashes, and it will normalise if reading in and writing
    out again.

    It only supports a very basic subset of the full YAML specification.

    Usage is targetted at files like Perl's META.yml, for which a small and
    easily-embeddable module would be highly useful.

    Features will only be added if they are human readable, and can be
    written in a few lines of code. Please don't be offended if your request
    is refused. Someone has to draw the line, and for YAML::Tiny that
    someone is me.

    If you need something with more power move up to YAML (4 megabytes of
    memory overhead) or YAML::Syck (275k, but requires libsyck and a C
    compiler).

    To restate, YAML::Tiny does not preserve your comments, whitespace, or
    the order of your YAML data. But it should round-trip from Perl
    structure to file and back again just fine.

METHODS
  new
    The constructor "new" creates and returns an empty "YAML::Tiny" object.

  read $filename
    The "read" constructor reads a YAML file, and returns a new "YAML::Tiny"
    object containing the contents of the file.

    Returns the object on success, or "undef" on error.

    When "read" fails, "YAML::Tiny" sets an error message internally you can
    recover via "YAML::Tiny->errstr". Although in some cases a failed "read"
    will also set the operating system error variable $!, not all errors do
    and you should not rely on using the $! variable.

  read_string $string;
    The "read_string" method takes as argument the contents of a YAML file
    (a YAML document) as a string and returns the "YAML::Tiny" object for
    it.

  write $filename
    The "write" method generates the file content for the properties, and
    writes it to disk to the filename specified.

    Returns true on success or "undef" on error.

  write_string
    Generates the file content for the object and returns it as a string.

  errstr
    When an error occurs, you can retrieve the error message either from the
    $YAML::Tiny::errstr variable, or using the "errstr()" method.
